# Facade Pattern 

Command pattern example.

## Description
Facade pattern provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework. 

In this example facade provides a simplified interaface to start the car. For the sake of simplicity lets define starting a car as starting the engine, turning on lights and air conditioning. Each of these objects (Engine, Lights, AC) have a class and methods. By creating a facade we can do all of those things in a simplified way.
