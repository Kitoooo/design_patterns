# Singleton Pattern 

Singleton pattern example based on [link](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton/) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUE_j6q0LTQ) with an implementation of the example.

## Description
Singleton is a design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

It does this by making the constructor private and making a static method for getting that single instance of that object.
