# Factory Method 

Factory Method example implementation based on [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcFVTgRHJLM) with an implementation of the example explained in the video. 

## Description
Main purpose of this pattern is to encapsulate the logic of the creation of different objects, with different types.
In this example - let's say we are building a simulation of a national park, and we need to create bunch of different animals.

In this example we have 2 different ways we could initialize them
  1. balanced - balanced amount of each of the animals
  2. random - randomly selected animal
