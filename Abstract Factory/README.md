# Abstract Factory Pattern 

Abstract Factory Pattern example based on [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-GiuMmsXj4) with an implementation of the example explained in the video.

## Description
The Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. 

This is example of UI library. And let's assume that for different platforms (Windows, Linux etc.) we have different concrete implementation. Abstract factory lets us use these concrete implementation interchangebly without knowing the exact implementation.
